<h1>Greetings mutuals,</h1>
<p>I am afraid,</p>
<p> but <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTKVcAeTxtE”>here's</a> a 'A Short Manifesto' by Stanely Brouwn to distract us all from the Impending Doom:</p>
<p> 4000 A.d when science and art are entirely melted together to something new when people will have lost their remembrance and thus will have no past, only future.</p>
<p>hen they will have to discover everything every moment again and again when they will have lost their need for contact with others .......</p>
<p>.. then they will live in a world of only</p>
<p>colour, light, space, time, time, sounds and movement then colour light space timesounds and movement will be</p>
<p>free</p>
<p>no music</p>
<p>no theater</p>
<p>	no art</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>there will be</p>
<p>sound </p>
<p>colour </p>
<p>lightspacetime</p>
<p>movement</p>
