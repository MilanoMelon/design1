<p> 4000 A.d when science and art are entirely melted together to something new when people will have lost their remembrance and thus will have no past, only future.</p>
<p>hen they will have to discover everything every moment again and again when they will have lost their need for contact with others .......</p>

<p>colour, light, space, time, time, sounds and movement then colour light space timesounds and movement will be</p>
<p>free</p>
<p>no music</p>
<p>no theater</p>
<p>	no art</p>
